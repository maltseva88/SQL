Applying SQL to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.

In this project, I accomplished three main tasks:

1). Data Modeling:
Define a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using your model.

2). Data Engineering: 
Create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate your database from the CSV files provided.

3). Data Analysis: 
Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
